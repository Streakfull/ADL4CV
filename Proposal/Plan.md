# Proposal Rough Plan

This is a rough plan of how to write the proposal and will become more detailed as we know further what exactly do we plan to do. This is **NOT** the proposal itself, just an idea about what will be written

### Section: 1 Intro & Motivation

- Summary about the topic (Project description)
- Summary of what we plan to do and how we are planning to work

### Section 2: Project Work Plan

- Read related work papers
- Detailed initial implementation plan (based on what we read & might be changed a long the way)
- What resources are going to use (Google colab etc..)
- What are the expected deliverables

### Section 3: Our Timeline

Might merge workplan & timeline into 1 section depending on space constraints
This section can be compactly represented as a table

- 23-4 => 3-5
  - MUST: Reading papers - writing project proposal
  - Optional: any initial implementation/tries, overall playing around and testing things
- 8-5 => 28-5
  - Receive feedback and incorprate it into our flow
  - Work on implementation
  - Preferably have a complete MVP with Okay-ish results
  - Have a strong idea about we plan to go forward
- 28-5 => 31-5

  - Work on presentation

- 1-6 => 25-6

  - Fine tune project - wipe out any technical debt - try to get better results
  - Optional: (depending on time and results) deployment

- 25-6 => 28-6
  - Work on second presentation
- 28-6 => 12-7
  - Final changes/improvements
